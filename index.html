Hey, I'am [Typing](https://github.com/williamcanin/typing-jekyll-template){: target="_blank"}. I'm a theme [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com){: target="_blank"} Inspired by the habit of typing. Using an appearance that resembles the typewriter. A simple, fast and efficient way of reading, just like the old days.

'Typing' is intended for users with more technical content than for users who wish to have a stylish page. Keep it simple!

**Let's see some details about this page:**

This page Hello exists to put everything about you, as if it were a simplified 'About'. The file for editing this page is in the directory root: `index.md`.

Hey Nerd! How is it? You're analyzing me, but are not you using me? Use me now! I'm not into embellishment.
